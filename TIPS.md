## Technical Part 

* Always Have Hashtable at the top of your mind

* Sorted Array -> Possibly Indicates Binary Search

* Duplicate Elements -> HashTable

* Sorting Array O(N  log(N)) - Best Time with Merge Sort

* Find Max Element Unsorted -> O(N) Comparision Algorithm

* Finding All Subsets -> O(2^n)

* Finding All Permutations -> O(N!)

## Behavioural Part

* Resume Walk-Through

* Current job -> Beginning of the career -> Go Towards Chronologically

* Quick shows of success

* Drive the interviewer with giving details of the projects that you took an interesting part

* Describe weaknesses, dont cover them

* Mention Hobbies -> HackerRank + Hackathons + Online Courses

## 3 Ways To Approach An Algorithm 

 1. **BUD**
    1. **Bottlenecks**: Find what causes the algorithm to be slow and fix its time complexity.
    2. **Unnecessary Work**: A unnecessary work after a condition is met could be avoided e.g. with break or pass statements.
    3. **Duplicate Work**: A repeated work could be avoided by look up tables.
 
 2. Space / Time Tradeoffs (Hash Tables)
 
 3.
## Solve Algorithms in 7 Steps

1. LISTEN THE QUESTION

2. HAVE AN EXAMPLE - NOT A SMALL CASE

3. THINK OF A BRUTE FORCE WORST CASE

4. OPTIMIZE THE ALGORITHM ON THE HAND

5. WALK THROUGH THE ALGORITHM - DATA STRUCTURES && STRUCTURE OF THE CODE && CONSISTENT + DESCRIPTIVE NAMING

6. CODE THE CODE

7. TEST THE CODE OF ALGORITHM BY RUNNING THE CODE STEP-By-STEP ON THE BOARD
