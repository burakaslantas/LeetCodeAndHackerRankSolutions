## Technical Part 

* Always Have Hashtable at the top of your mind

* Write functions to keep everything clean and easily changeable

* Sorted Array -> Possibly Indicates Binary Search

* Duplicate Elements -> HashTable

* Sorting Array O(N  log(N)) - Best Time with Merge Sort

* Find Max Element Unsorted -> O(N) Comparision Algorithm

* Finding All Subsets -> O(2^n)

* Finding All Permutations -> O(N!)

* HashSets -> No Duplicates + Internally contains HashMap + Stores set such as {1, 4, 7, 23, 14}, Key and Values are the same

## Behavioural Part

* Resume Walk-Through

* Current job -> Beginning of the career -> Go Towards Chronologically

* Quick shows of success

* Drive the interviewer with giving details of the projects that you took an interesting part

* Describe weaknesses, dont cover them

* Mention Hobbies -> HackerRank + Hackathons + Online Courses

## 3 Ways To Approach An Algorithm 

 1. **BUD**
    1. **Bottlenecks**: Find what causes the algorithm to be slow and fix its time complexity.
    2. **Unnecessary Work**: A unnecessary work after a condition is met could be avoided e.g. with break or pass statements.
    3. **Duplicate Work**: A repeated work could be avoided by look up tables.
 
 2. **Space / Time Tradeoffs (Hash Tables)**
 
 3. **D.I.Y:** Solve the algorithm my your brain and copy that algorithm to your code.
## Solve Algorithms in 7 Steps

1. LISTEN THE QUESTION - ASK FOR CLARIFICATION IF NEEDED

2. HAVE AN EXAMPLE - NOT A SMALL CASE

3. THINK OF A BRUTE FORCE WORST CASE

4. OPTIMIZE THE ALGORITHM ON THE HAND

5. WALK THROUGH THE ALGORITHM - DATA STRUCTURES && STRUCTURE OF THE CODE && CONSISTENT + DESCRIPTIVE NAMING

6. CODE THE CODE

7. TEST THE CODE OF ALGORITHM BY RUNNING THE CODE STEP-By-STEP ON THE BOARD WITH A DIFFERENT SMALLER TEST CASE THAN 2. + AN EDGE CASE
