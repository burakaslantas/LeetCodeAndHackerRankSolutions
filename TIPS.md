**Technical Part**

* Always Have Hashtable at the top of your mind

* Sorted Array -> Possibly Indicates Binary Search

* Duplicate Elements -> HashTable

* Sorting Array O(N  log(N)) - Best Time with Merge Sort

* Find Max Element Unsorted -> O(N) Comparision Algorithm

* Finding All Subsets -> O(2^n)

* Finding All Permutations -> O(N!)

**Behavioural Part**

* Resume Walk-Through

* Current job -> Beginning of the career -> Go Towards Chronologically

* Quick shows of success

* Drive the interviewer with giving details of the projects that you took an interesting part

* Describe weaknesses, dont cover them

* Mention Hobbies -> HackerRank + Hackathons + Online Courses

**3 Ways To Approach An Algorithm**


**Solve Algorithms in 7 Steps**

* LISTEN THE QUESTION

* HAVE AN EXAMPLE - NOT A SMALL CASE

* THINK OF A BRUTE FORCE WORST CASE

* OPTIMIZE THE ALGORITHM ON THE HAND

* WALK THROUGH THE ALGORITHM - DATA STRUCTURES && STRUCTURE OF THE CODE && CONSISTENT + DESCRIPTIVE NAMING

* CODE THE CODE

* TEST THE CODE OF ALGORITHM BY RUNNING THE CODE STEP-By-STEP ON THE BOARD
